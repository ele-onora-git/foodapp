## FOODAPP
Carbon Foodprint is a mobile application for Android smartphones that aims to be a digital food diary with an inbuilt carbon footprint calculator. It allows registered users to browse through the food catalogue and input food entries into the diary on a daily basis. The diary then calculates the carbon footprint, displays total value for each day and visualises the data with pie charts. The Carbon Foodprintâ€™s goal is to be an accessible, simple, and comprehensive tool that will bring carbon-awareness into its users' everyday eating decisions and encourage a habitual transition towards a more sustainable lifestyle by utilising the psychology of self-tracking.
